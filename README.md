# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- Using Tailwind
- Using ESLint
- Using Prettier
- Using Jest
- Using Cypress
- Using Storybook
- Using Assest and components folder structure for organization.
- Login functionality is still in Progress - So application starting point is from - http://localhost:3000/dashboard
- However navigation between pages works through Routing, and dashboard can be accessed.
- Created a mock server - use command - npm run server to activate the API endpoint.
